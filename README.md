# Bad cookie
This is a **(really bad)** remake of the Idle game "Cookie clicker"

## Technical
- The project uses svelte for the UI with vanilla css
- The logic is handled using TS

## Architechture
- The data handling is based on TS classes
- Each class is fully capable of taking care of itself
- The structure is made to be scalable. It shouldnt be hard to add new content, *I just dont feel like it*
 
## Purpose
- This project showcases the ability of OOP to organize data and provide a nice separation of concerns, while providing a significant level of abstraction
- This project showcases TS ability to keep code scalable trough the Type system
